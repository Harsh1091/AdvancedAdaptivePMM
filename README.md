# AdvancedAdaptivePMM
This strategy is a customized Advanced Adaptive Passive Market Maker (AdvancedAdaptivePMM) built on top of Hummingbot’s ScriptStrategyBase. It enhances traditional PMM by combining:
•	Volatility-aware dynamic spreads
•	Multi-level layered order book participation
•	Inventory skew compensation
•	Trade-triggered order refresh cycles
•	Aggressive fill-focused behavior using tighter spreads
The core idea is to simulate a realistic yet optimized paper trading environment, allowing for better estimation of profitability and risk in changing market conditions — without introducing active speculation or complex technical indicators.

⚙️ Assumptions and Trade-offs
Assumption	Description	Trade-off
💱 Sufficient Liquidity	Market is reasonably liquid (e.g., ETH/USDT)	May underperform in illiquid or wide-spread pairs
🧾 Static Base Order Size	Base order amount is fixed and small	May require manual tuning for high-volatility assets
⚡ No Latency Arbitrage	Orders are based on mid-price and volatility	Not suitable for HFT or latency-sensitive execution
📊 Simple Trend Logic	Trend signals and external filters are excluded	Increases stability but reduces directional alpha

🛡️ Key Risk Management Principles
1.	💸 Budget-Aware Order Validation
Every order is checked against the available balance with a 10% buffer — preventing accidental over-allocation.
2.	📉 Volatility-Tied Spread Adjustment
The strategy tightens or widens spreads based on rolling standard deviation, ensuring resilience in volatile conditions.
3.	⚖️ Inventory Skew Control
Using dynamic buy/sell sizing, the bot aims to keep base/quote ratios near 50%, reducing directional inventory risk.
4.	⏱️ Order Refresh Triggers
Orders are refreshed when prices deviate beyond 0.5% or after 60 seconds, ensuring relevance in fast-moving markets.
5.	🔄 Multi-Level Orders
Placing multiple orders on both sides with increasing spacing increases the chance of partial fills, reducing slippage risk.
